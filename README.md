The main object is the study and analysis of the paper $\textbf{"Constrained proteome allocation affects coexistence in models of competitive microbial communities"}$ published on January 2021 by Leonardo Pacciani Mori, Samir Suweis, Amos Maritan, Andrea Giometto.

Microbial communities are ubiquitous and play crucial roles in many natural processes. Despite their importance for the environment, industry and human health, there are still many aspects of microbial community dynamics that we do not understand quantitatively. Recent experiments have shown that the structure and composition of microbial communities are intertwined with the metabolism of the species that inhabit them, suggesting that properties at the intracellular level such as the allocation of cellular proteomic resources must be taken into account when describing microbial communities with a population dynamics approach. In this work, i am going to reconsider one of the theoretical frameworks most commonly used to model population dynamics in competitive ecosystems, MacArthurâ€™s consumer-resource model, in light of experimental evidence showing how proteome allocation affects microbial growth. This new framework allows to describe community dynamics at an intermediate level of complexity between classical consumer-resource models and biochemical models of microbial metabolism, accounting for temporally-varying proteome allocation subject to constraints on growth and protein synthesis in the presence of multiple resources, while preserving analytical insight into the dynamics of the system.

In this analysis i created from scratch an algorithm able to simulate the consumer proteome resource model, all the plots that are present in the article and a further exploration on the distribution of metabolic strategies with respect to eaten resources. The latter is really interesting since the bins domain of $\varphi_{\sigma i}$ for $i=1,2,3$ becomes thinner and thinner during time, meaning that predators start to be specialist in the sense that few predators eat the whole amount of the resources $i=1,2,3$.
